## Project Objective

The goal of this project is for us to apply the concepts learned by building a basic full-stack application with Node + Express + Mongo + React. It is designed to cater to the needs of both employees and managers. Employees can easily clock in their work hours, while managers can review and monitor employee time shifts.

## Typography

Heading -- sans-serif


Paragraphs -- Arial

## Color Palettes
For the login and register pages, we used this color palette:
